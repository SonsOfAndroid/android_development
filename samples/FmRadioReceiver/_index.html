<a href="../../../reference/android/fm/FmReceiver.html">android.fm.FmReceiver</a>
class to implement a FM Radio receiver in an application. The application allows the
user to tune to any local radio stations, switch between them, scan for new stations and
mute the radio. It also allows the user to change the radio band to their suit their location.
The use of listeners is shown to display the tuned station name if RDS data is present.</p>
